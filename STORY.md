**Note:** this is a work document that helped me craft the story.
It's not supposed to be readable by anyone else than its author ðŸ˜‰

## Questions & DÃ©ductions
- [x] comment l'impÃ©ratrice se retrouve dans un monastÃ¨re ?
  & pourquoi a-t-elle perdu la mÃ©moire ?
- [x] pourquoi le monde est-il bloquÃ© dans un crÃ©puscule sans fin ?
  & avec qui l'ImpÃ©ratrice a-t-elle passÃ© un pacte ?
- [x] where is the AMULET hidden? and why is it important / belongs to the statue?
  & where the fuck come the bottle in the canal from ?
- [x] comment est mort Dominic ?

## Enjeux
- stopper le crÃ©puscule sans fin & lever la malÃ©diction
- retrouver la mÃ©moire du personnage principal

## Personnages
- **Lyssa** : avatar & heroine, strong will, lost memory
  Secret : il s'agit de l'ImpÃ©ratrice
- **Seamus** : wizard, Lyssa's friend, encourage & guide her
  Secret: turn into a flying demon at the end
- **Empress **: powerful ruler who has cast a curse on the whole realm, in order to get her knight lover back
- **Dominic**: saint knight, protector of the realm, strom dragon slayer

## ScÃ¨nes
- intro
    **INTENT**: mysterious build-up that can be understood at the end + introduce Seamus + 1st interactive (fake) choice
- Seamus voice from small window
    **INTENT**: explain situation & monsters + give a clear goal + teach BACKSPACE ability
- leaving Scriptorium
    **INTENT**: undying dusk exposition + minimap explanation
- Monastery Library: 7 bookshelves
- outside Monastery:
    **INTENT**: Seamus cast spell to heal up Lyssa + give advice/guidance to Lyssa (inc. village + holy water in well) + mention lost memory + The Empress curse exposition
- Chapel in the Woods
    **INTENT**: get crucifix + show a solitary monk about to transform
- entering Cedar village
    **INTENT**: mention spared villagers in need for help
- @Cedar village inn, on 1st night of rest
    **INTENT**: Saint Knight legend: how he has beaten the storm dragon
- in a corner of Zuruth Plains
    **INTENT**: teach find/teleport spell (CTRL+F = Close you eyes, and leT youR heaRt Find it) to help get AMULET + aim @ Templar academy / blessing & Sage Therel sorcerer
- Templar academy: first 2 bookshelves
- Templar academy: next 4 bookshelves
- Templar academy: final 4 bookshelves
- after beating Zuruth Plains skeleton:
    **INTENT**: Seamus congratulates Lyssa + plan to follow knight footsteps & defy Empress + give 1st piece of armor
- Mausoleum: 2 bookshelves next to portal + 1 behind a mimic, north-west
- entering final level, before the dragon
- Seamus reveal after 2nd arch in last level -> facing flying demon
    **INTENT**: make it ambiguous if he is a vilain or simply consumed by the cursed
- beating boss: scene_mirror
    **INTENT**: big reveal + tragic ending that gives closure + clue to secret ending

## Self-imposed constraints
- Bechdel test: 2 named women talk to each other about something other than a man
- donner un objectif / rÃ´le clair Ã  l'hÃ©roÃ¯ne dÃ¨s le dÃ©but
- twist final: l'hÃ©roÃ¯ne est l'impÃ©ratrice. She had a murderous frenzy?

## IdÃ©es en vrac
- faire dÃ©couvrir la crÃ©puscule Ã©ternel in-game, en sortant du Scriptorium
- present BACKSPACE as a time-rewinding device
- CTRL+F = teleport spell, taught by Seamus -> 1 explicit use / 1 implicit / 1 secret ending
- more characters: goblin? sage Therel? (use monk img?)

## Replace gems by more immersive items
- [x] Magic Emerald (+5 HP Up) [Monastery Trail] -> Seamus give bonus (36), chest treasure replaced by empty bottle (34)
                                                    that must combined with well & crucifix (38) found in chapel
- [x] Magic Sapphire (+2 MP Up) [Zuruth Plains] -> replaced by statue giving blessing once wearing amulet (35)
- [x] Magic Ruby (Atk Boost) [Canal Boneyard] -> fire providing magical boost (37)
- [x] Magic Diamond (restore MP) [flying demon / Seamus battle reward] -> OK to preserve this one
